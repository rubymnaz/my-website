            <h1 class="blog-title" style="margin-top: 120px; padding-top: 30px ;">History of Qatar</h1>
            <img src="nozip/HOQ Village.png" alt="HOQ 1">
            <p>Qatar's history dates back to the Stone Age, with archaeological evidence highlighting ancient settlements and trade routes. It was part of the Dilmun civilization in the 3rd millennium BCE and interacted with cultures like Mesopotamia, Persia, and India due to its strategic location. In the pre-Islamic era, Qatar became known for maritime activities like pearling, which later played a crucial role in its economy.
            
                With the advent of Islam in the 7th century CE, Qatar joined the Islamic Caliphates, starting with the Rashidun, followed by the Umayyads and Abbasids. This period integrated Qatar into the Islamic world, fostering trade, religion, and cultural development. The region also witnessed the rise and fall of local dynasties and tribal groups, shaping its diverse heritage.</p>
            <h2 class="blog-title" style="margin-top: 120px;">Pearling and The Al Thani Family</h2>
                <p>By the 18th and 19th centuries, Qatar flourished as a key player in the pearling industry. Its maritime expertise and location along trade routes made it an essential hub, drawing interest from powerful neighbors like the Ottomans and Persians. Pearling and trade formed the backbone of its economy until the introduction of Japanese cultured pearls in the early 20th century.

                    During this time, the Al Thani family rose to prominence. In 1851, Sheikh Mohammed bin Thani became Qatar’s first ruler, solidifying the family’s influence. Despite regional challenges, including pressure from the Ottoman Empire, the Al Thani family maintained Qatar's autonomy and laid the groundwork for its modern political structure.</p>
        
            <h1 class="blog-title">British Protectorate and Oil Discovery</h1>
            <img src="nozip/HOQ Oil.png" alt="Oil">
            <p>In 1916, Qatar signed a treaty with Britain, becoming a protectorate. This agreement secured British oversight in defense and foreign relations while allowing Qatar internal autonomy. However, the global pearling industry’s decline due to Japanese cultured pearls marked an economic downturn.

                The discovery of oil in 1939 transformed Qatar's fortunes. By 1949, oil exports began, driving rapid modernization and urbanization. The wealth generated from oil enabled Qatar to develop infrastructure, healthcare, and education, propelling it toward becoming one of the world’s richest nations.</p>

              <h1 class="blog-title">Independence and Modern Qatar</h1>
              <img src="nozip/Corniche 3.png" alt="Corniche">
              <p>Qatar declared independence from Britain in 1971, adopting its first constitution in 1972 and establishing itself as a constitutional monarchy under the Al Thani family. The nation played an active role in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and steadily expanded its political and economic influence in the region.

                 In the 21st century, Qatar diversified its economy under Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, investing in sectors like finance, sports, and education. Hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup was a historic milestone, highlighting Qatar's international prominence. Cultural projects like the Museum of Islamic Art and Katara Cultural Village emphasize Qatar’s blend of tradition and modernity, securing its role as a global leader in art, culture, and development.</p>
